# Countdown

A simple countdown powered by Vue.js, inspired by [TAKAHASHI's Digital Clock](https://codepen.io/gau/pen/LjQwGp).

You can visit https://countdown.hikariyo.net/ or use your custom date like https://countdown.hikariyo.net?until=20240102.

For the until param, please provide either 8 digits for the date (YYYYMMDD) or 14 digits for the full timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHmmss).

It **works best on PC**, though mobiles are still adapted.

When the countdown ends, it will show `00d 00h 00m 00s` rather than negative numbers.
